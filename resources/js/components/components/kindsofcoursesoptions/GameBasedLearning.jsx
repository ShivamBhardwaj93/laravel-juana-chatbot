        <h2>What is Game-Based Learning?</h2>
        <p>
          Game-based learning is an educational approach that utilizes the
          power of games to motivate and engage learners. By incorporating game
          elements like points, badges, leaderboards, challenges, and
          storylines, it transforms the learning process into an
          immersive and enjoyable experience.
